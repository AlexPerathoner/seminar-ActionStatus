# ActionStatus

Action Status is a small utility for macOS, iOS and tvOS, which displays the status of Github Actions.

It also allows you to auto-generate workflows to test your Swift projects against a matrix of Swift versions and platforms.

A pre-build version is available for free download in the App Store.
